# Community-Detection-Methods
Community Detection is one of the most popular methods for analysis of Big Data sets that stem from complex network topologies. Most real networks have a community structure, i.e., their nodes are organised in groups and most of the time they share a common property. As the size and complexity of networks increases, detecting communities in graphs is becoming a difficult computational problem, creating the need to develop methods that will yield satisfactory results in a short time.

In the framework of this diploma thesis, the basic techniques of Community Detection in big graphs were initially studied. Thereafter, based on the existing literature, two algorithms were selected, representing two different types of approaches. The first is Hyperbolic Girvan-Newman, which is a variant of the classical Girvan-Newman algorithm. Their difference is that HGN employs network graph embedding in the Hyperbolic Space. At the second stage, Walktrap algorithm was implemented, which is based on Random Walks.

Then the efficiency of both HGN and Walktrap was studied on data from small-scale Social Networks and a comparison of the results between these two methods was attempted. These results are presented thoroughly using tables and diagrams in the respective chapter of this Diploma Thesis.
